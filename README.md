# Intersection Observer Demo

A demonstration of a basic use case of the new Intersection Observer API, contrasted with the equivalent scroll observer implementation. The demo is not at a scale sufficient for the user to notice the performance advantage, but still useful for demonstrative purposes.

## Usage 

Install packages by running `yarn` in the base directory, then simply run `yarn serve` and navigate to the given address. To fiddle around with the inner workings and see the changes reflected live, run `yarn dev`.
